## Packages
(none needed)

## Notes
Use existing shadcn/ui components already in repo (Dialog, Select, Toast, etc.)
Google Calendar provider is supported; Lark appears in UI but should be disabled with "준비 중" messaging
All API calls must use @shared/routes `api` paths + zod schemas for validation, with credentials: "include"
SEO: each page sets document.title + meta description
Add data-testid to all interactive + key display elements
